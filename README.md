# vrc-stuff

Monorepo for 20kdc VRChat projects.

Includes:

* `kip32`: Compiling C (via RISC-V) to Udon (and beyond?)
* `kvtools`: Utilities for 20kdc worlds and development.
* `vrc-sigmar`: An implementation of Sigmar's Garden (from [Zachtronics's Opus Magnum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/)) as an asset for VRChat worlds.
	* (A proper demo world for this asset is pending a lot of work that may not happen.)
* `vrc-textslidesystem`: A system to, i.e. let people on a stage broadcast their prewritten announcements on a text display. (Text can also be input live.)
